Second Submission Notes: 
The first program I submitted used the factorial method of generating Pascal's
Triangle, Problems with the first code submitted was that it did not print the list of lists,
it did not print any string lists on separate lines.

The new submission of the same problem uses several functions that generate lists and prints them. It stores a list of
numbers for each row in one list It then prints each row separately and finally prints a string version of the rows
in the shape of a triangle.
